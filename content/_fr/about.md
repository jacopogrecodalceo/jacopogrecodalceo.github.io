Creation is a compromise between reality and abstraction.
In his pieces, Jacopo Greco d'Alceo seeks less and less distance between the two, reducing the gap between body and work. The composer becomes the pieces: he makes them from his own flesh and experience, he is part of them. They are an extension of our raw material body which changes, suffers, rots and ages. Artworks must react, too. Artistic forms must burst in our contemporary and contextual expression. They can no longer be stuck in the same medium. The twisted connections behind all his works now become clear, just as discovering the silhouette of a dancer in the background: what at a first glance may seem different paths and pieces, now becomes one and only solid line. Perhaps different variations of a long piece, it has no interest in remaining attached to a fixed genre or form, but aims to dig and dig deeper to seize a fragment of truth and personal expression.

Jacopo is lauréat de la Fondation Royaumont.
