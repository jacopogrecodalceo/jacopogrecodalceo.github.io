*Chiedimi le mie radici* is a stage piece. 

A dancer alone performs all the 45-minuts long odyssey on an essential and minimal space which is the instrument and the scenography of this piece surrounded by a quadraphonic speaker system. This instrument consists of a square wooden platform, divided into four pieces. Each piece is independently amplified with a contact microphone, allowing for the allocation of a physical space of the instrument to each sound source of the quadraphonic setup. This approach explodes the instrumental microstructure on the scenic and spatial level, creating writing challenges and a genuine dramaturgy of space. This configuration also departs from a more traditional frontality, offering the audience different angles of view and listening depending on the performance venue.

The instrument serves as the canvas for writing, and the performer becomes the expression of the image projected by the stage, evolving within this constrained space. The wood, the material of the instrument, generates a raw, visceral, highly gestural sound. It seeks a connection with the natural elements that construct and shape the human being at its deepest and most subjective core. The dancer embodies a primal nature in transformation, a bodily arborescence anchored in space by its roots. This idea thus evokes the notion of homeland, the land where one grew up, or simply a familiar place to which one is attached - despite oneself. It is often desired when one moves away from it, and there are particular words to describe the complexity of this sentiment: for example, *nostalgia*, *saudade*, or from afar, *Sehnsucht*.

But in truth, one cannot articulate this deep longing with words. The piece seeks to hold onto this sensation for a moment; this abstract tension, this languor, this constant longing for an ideal that struggles against the weight of time.

At this point, words end, this creation begins.
