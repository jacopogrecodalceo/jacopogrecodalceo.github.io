with *Mélisande Tonolo*

She, alone, performs all the 45-minutes long odyssey. An essential and minimal space is the **instrument** and the **scenography** of this piece. Her only surrounding: the audience and four speakers.

The custom-made instrument is a square platform, divided into four pieces. Each piece is independently amplified, allowing the physical space to be directly connected to each speaker of the quadraphonic setup.
The wooden material, generates a raw, visceral, highly gestural sound — a connection with the natural elements that construct and shape the human being at its deepest and most subjective core. The dancer embodies this nature in transformation, a bodily arborescence anchored in space by its roots.
The piece seeks to hold these sensations for a brief moment; this abstract tension, this languor, this constant longing for an immaterial ideal that struggles against the weight of time.

At this point, words end, this creation begins.
