_Soffio_ is a personal exploration of Bramante's painting "Cristo alla colonna" (_Christ at the Column_). The breath, in an almost ironic sense, represents the expression of human materiality and corporeality, just as Christ forcefully imposes himself within the painting's space. The body is portrayed in a disquieting manner, stripped of the mysticism typically associated with this figure, but profoundly human. In this work, the electroacoustic component, often linked to ethereal and abstract concepts, is laid bare and placed at the forefront. It is brutal, yet intricately sculpted, down to the finest details. Each sound detail, timbre, and resonance is the result of meticulous work dedicated to the painting.

This creation is founded on the quest for potential musical interpretations of an image, akin to interpreting a musical score. An algorithm analyses the painting's contrasts and luminosity to translate this data into sound. The video presents this analytical approach, revealing specific details, while the double bass becomes the primary material. Its commanding instrumental presence merges with the instrumentalist, forming a single entity. A profound and intense dialogue ensues, characterised by decisive and physical gestures, as well as delicate moments.

Soloists do not take precedence; the three elements are treated equally and intervene at the opportune moments. It is the evolving relationships between these elements that shape the work. The structure is defined by expansive gestural sections contrasting with sections of intense development and schizophrenia â€“ moments when the elements converge and collide in both forceful and subtle ways. Thus, an intimate and violent contrast is once again brought to the forefront, becoming the central theme of this work.
