**Cordelia presents Cordelia**: _ultralove_
Composition is embodied in the idea of livecoding, a form of musical creation in real time in the mind and on the screen of the composer. An abstract and personal language becomes the intermediary between musical thought and its concrete, temporal and dramaturgical action. Vibrato, the constant movement to which sound is immutably bound in a space, becomes the fruitful ground of a piece. This becoming of sound only exists through its presence, through a voluntary act, through a desire. The material is shaped to give life to the extreme virtuosities that only the electroacoustic instrument allows to hear, leaving to the listener all the beauty of the interpretation.
