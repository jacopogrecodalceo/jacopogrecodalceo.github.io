Electroacoustic music and classical dance meet. It's much more than a simple fusion of artistic disciplines, though.
It's a bold exploration, a dialogue between the past manifesting in the present and the present resonating with the past. Each moment is the fruit of a dialogue between movement sculpted by tradition and sound breathing in the present.

Thanks to Pierre Darde for this incredible collaboration.
