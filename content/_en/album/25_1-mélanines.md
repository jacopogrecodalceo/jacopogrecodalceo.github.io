Bright and joyful palettes of sound, painted by an craftman in love with sound and composition – a smile facing the sun, tense, vibrant, fists clenched, under the shadow of mechanical and industrial remnants of another time. In another form, but in the same way as Fernand Léger.

**"mélanines"** is an embodied relationship with pigments and the nuances of the Nouveau Réalisme movement, conceived as a **sound journey // album** for the exhibition **"tous léger"** at the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris from **March 19 to July 20, 2025**, in collaboration with the label [Tsuku Boshi](https://tsukuboshi.wordpress.com).

Each piece, whether brief or persistent, absorbs the gaze, the polychromy, bouncing off shapes and materials.  
Sounds emerge and recombine as one moves through the exhibition: **inviting a fragmented, mobile listening experience**.  
Like a second glance at a painting, a sculpture, where the first impression fades to let other echoes arise.  
The compositions suggest a texture, a color, a line, a sparkle, leaving the listener free to reconstruct their own trajectory.  
An invitation to navigate the exhibition differently, to layer sight and sound, to experience a **new sensibility** through a circulation that is constantly renewed by its context.

### The connection with the exhibition?  
The desire to reveal a **beauty expressed through unusual, hidden, marginal, and minority sounds**.  
To détour these sonorities, to listen to them differently, to shift perspective.  
A longing to revive the discussion around **beauty**, transforming it into a living space of communication in constant metamorphosis.
